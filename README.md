# Malicious-URL-Detection
My first project focuses on detecting malicious URLs using transformer models, especially BERT. A key part of my work is class imbalance. I study how detection performance changes under different data distributions: when benign URLs greatly outnumber malicious ones, when malicious URLs dominate, and when both classes are balanced.
