# Malicious-URL-Detection
My first project focuses on analyzing the impact of class imbalance on RoBERTa-based malicious URL detection. 
I study how detection performance changes under different data distributions: when benign URLs greatly outnumber malicious ones, when malicious URLs dominate, and when both classes are balanced.
